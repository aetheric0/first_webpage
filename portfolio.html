            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Hi, I am Mornark, a tech hobbyist and software engineering intern at PLP.
                Ever since I touched a computer at age 12, I've always been fascinated about
                how the computer works. I tend to spend most of my days breaking codes to see
                how they work haha ðŸ˜…. Thankfully I haven't done too much harm to innocent
                binary files.
                <br><br>
                I always tell people coding begins with curiosity, as curiosity sparks interest
                and interest ignites obsession! (yes we programmers are all obsessed otherwise we
                won't spend hours building and more frustrating hours debugging!).

            <p>This section describes the list of projects currently being worked on.
                I am focused on creativity and innovation to build stunning state-of-the-art
                modern webapps that are fast, efficient, scalable and maintanable.
